    vehicleInfo: The Amphibious Vehicle, Tracked, Amoured, Mark 1 - LVT(A)(1) is
      the first (armoured, infantry support) variant of the Amphibious Vehicle, Tracked
      (LVT) family. Originally designed and used as cargo ship carriers for ship-to-shore
      operations to transport personnel and materials, they gradually evolved into
      amphibious fire support vehicles, as well as other amphibious assault landing
      variants. The first armoured, infantry support variant of the LVT was the LVT(A)
      Mark 1. With the first combat experience of Pacific amphibious operations for
      the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marines, it was evident that more firepower than the
      M2HB Browning heavy machine gun commonly utilized by the U.S. Marines was required.

    vehicleInfo: The M22, also known as the Light Tank (Locust) M22, is a World War
      II airborne light tank designed by the U.S. Army for the British Airborne Forces.
      In 1941, the British War Office requested that the American government design
      a purpose-built airborne light tank that could be transported by military glider
      into the battlefield to provide direct armoured fire support for the British
      Airborne Forces. The British War Office had previously decided that the British
      Airborne Forces would be equipped with the Light Tank Mark VII "Tetrarch".

    vehicleInfo: The Heavy Tank M6A1 is a rank III American heavy tank with a battle
      rating of 4.7 (AB) and 5.0 (RB/SB). It was one of the first American tanks
      to be released with the American ground tree in Update 1.45 "Steel Generals".
      A rather unusual tank design mounting two cannons in the turret, however, it
      has a durable frontal armour for the battle rating it occupies.

    vehicleInfo: The armor is almost the same as the armor the one of the M6A1 has,
      it just has more angled and rounded for better ricochet chances and efficient
      armour thickness. The weak spots are the viewing slit to the right of the machine
      guns and the unangled part on the lower hull.

    vehicleInfo: The M4A3E2 Sherman - Assault Tank is an armoured modification of
      the M4A3, which is the fourth variant of the early-generation Medium Tank M4
      (Sherman) family. The U.S. Army decided in early 1944 that they needed an armoured
      version of a medium tank for an assault role in the forthcoming European Theatre
      of Operations (ETO). However, they had previously rejected proposals for such
      a vehicle, and time was running out. The decision was made to modify the newest
      standard U.S. Army medium tank of the time, the M4A3 Sherman, since the new
      T26E1-1 heavy tank prototype would not be ready in time and earlier designs
      had been completely inadequate for the role. The vehicle evolved into the M4A3E2
      Sherman - Assault tank, sometimes known as the Sherman Jumbo.

    vehicleInfo: The frontal armour is quite strong, able to resist common weapons
      such as the 7,5 cm KwK42 and the 8,8 cm KwK43 if angled properly. A notable
      weak spot on the front glacis is the machine gun port but it is a small target
      difficult to hit with precision. The other notable weak spot is the lower front
      plate. With a relatively thin lower glacis, it is not able to absorb rounds
      from most guns, and there is no transmission to absorb a penetrating shell.
      However, the side armour can protect you to a certain degree when angled.

    vehicleInfo: With the development of the T26E3 Pershing tank, the US Army found
      themselves with an adequate heavy tank for the European theater, but it was
      still not to parity with the latest German heavy tank, the Tiger II. The long
      88 mm KwK43 cannon proves superior to the 90 mm M3 cannon on the Pershing,
      and so the US Army Ordnance Department developed a new gun to improve the 90
      mm cannon's penetration capability, the 90 mm T15. This was successfully installed
      into a T26E1 prototype, informally designated T26E1-1. The vehicle found itself
      sent to Europe for combat trials in March 1945.

      rating of 7.0 (AB) and 6.7 (RB/SB). It was introduced in Update 1.67 "Assault".
      A formidable heavy tank with thick armour and heavy gun, the T34 presents a
      radical new tank design, more so than any of its predecessors.

    vehicleInfo: The Heavy Tank T32 is a rank V American heavy tank with a battle
      rating of 7.3 (AB/RB/SB). It was one of the first American tanks to be released
      with the American ground tree in Update 1.45 "Steel Generals". It can be seen
      as an extremely buffed up version of a M26 Pershing with a high velocity 90
      mm gun and extremely tough front turret armour able to exploit hull down positions
      against its competitors. The T32 is a post-World War II heavy tank with 7.3
      Battle Rating, and it's one of the best tanks for a specific battle tactic
      known as hull-down. Due to its 298 mm thick frontal turret armour, it will
      mostly deflect any incoming armour-piercing shells at any range, except incoming
      High-Explosive Anti-Tank Fin-Stabilized (HEATFS)

    vehicleInfo: The Heavy Tank T32E1 is a rank V American heavy tank with a battle
      rating of 7.7 (AB/RB/SB). It was introduced in Update 1.83 "Masters of the
      Sea". Being the next stage of its development cycle, the T32E1 is essentially
      the same as the T32 except the designers replaced the cast homogeneous plates
      of the front hull in favour of simpler rolled homogeneous ones, deleting the
      hull machine gun port in the process. This not only removes an obvious weakness
      from the design, but it also strengthened the front hull plate from penetrations.

      battle rating of 7.7 (AB/RB/SB). It was one of the first American tanks to
      be released with the American ground tree in Update 1.45 "Steel Generals".
      The pinnacle of US heavy armour, armed with a monstrous 120mm gun and a nigh
      impenetrable gun mantlet, it can become an almost unstoppable foe if played

    vehicleInfo: The Tank, Combat, Full-Tracked, 152 mm Gun/Launcher XM-803, developed
      from the MBT-70, was part of the abandoned collaborative U.S. and West German
      initiative to develop a new main battle tank to replace the existing M60 family
      of MBTduring the 1960s. The program experienced significant challenges from
      the start, with the United States Army and the German Bundeswehr having diverging
      doctrines that were not coordinated and were not resolved before the project
      was too far along to be modified. By the late 1960s, West Germany abandoned
      the project and the U.S. solely funded the project for the next few years.

    vehicleInfo: In 1932, before testing with the XP-936 was done, the U.S. Army
      issued a statement for an improved XP-936 for production. Only a year later,
      the USAAC ordered over 100 examples with the designation P-26A. It was to be
      fitted with the Pratt & Whitney R-1340-27 Wasp radial engine that also boasted
      a supercharger. The R-1340-27 made around 500 hp but later variants made 600
      hp. P-26As were delivered not long after and proved to be a decently advanced
      aircraft for its time. The P-26A-34 M2 Peashooter has been in the game since
      the start of the Open Beta Test prior to Update 1.27. Although the P-26 is
      a monoplane, it has an impressive turn radius but bi-planes are still far better
      in terms of turning.

    vehicleInfo: "The P-26 was one of Boeing\u2019s first monoplane aircraft and
      was quite advanced at its time. It was relatively fast thanks to its all-metal
      construction and the R-1340, a 9-cylinder radial engine that produced around
      ~550 HP. It was an extremely successful engine and was quickly innovated from
      originally making a measly 400 HP to almost 600 HP thanks to better fuels,
      forged engine parts, and improved cowlings. The P-26B was fitted with a fuel-injected
      version of the Wasp and landing flaps that greatly reduced the dangerous landing
      speed from 82 mph (131.2 km/h) to 73 mph (116.8 km/h)."

    vehicleInfo: This later mark of the A-model Kingcobra is quite similar to the
      earlier P-63A-5. Aside from the striking golden target camouflage, the airframe
      itself only has minor detail differences. Internally, it has modified armament
      and extra engine power. The best-performing Kingcobra at low altitudes, the
      P-63A-10 is a versatile fighter with good speed, climb, armament, and agility.
      Intercepting bombers up high, zooming around at sea level with a hefty bombload,
      and diving on unfortunate victims with talons drawn are all within a day's
      work for this lethal aircraft. It requires some finesse to fly but can give
      feared opponents like the Bf 109 F-4 a serious run for their money.

    vehicleInfo: 'The P-63C-5 Kingcobra has been present since the start of the Open
      Beta Test prior to Update 1.27. It features a far better engine than the previous
      P-63A but also retains the four 12.7 mm machine guns and 37 mm cannon mounted
      through the propeller hub. The Allison V-1710-117 helps the P-63 perform much
      better at low altitude but high-altitude performance still leaves much to be
      desired. Players should stick to low-altitude fighting where the Kingcobra
      shines. For ground attack, the Kingcobra also has three 500 lb bombs, two mounted
      on either wing and one mounted in the centre. The 37 mm cannon also has access
      to AP rounds however it''s ill-advised to use them against armoured targets
      due to their low velocity. '

    vehicleInfo: The United States Navy showed clear interest in expanding the capabilities
      of the Crusader series of aircraft as quickly as possible to expand its role
      in maritime operations and offer primitive close-air support capabilities.
      This led to the development of the F8U-2NE (later renamed the F-8E), which
      featured a larger nose cone, new AN/APQ-94 fire control radar, detachable pylons,
      a more reliable J57-P-20 engine, and guidance equipment for the AGM-12 Bullpup
      missiles. The first prototype, a modified F8U-1 (No. 143710), was flown on
      June 30, 1961, and the aircraft was quickly approved for use by the Navy. During
      the Vietnam War, the Marine Corps made extensive use of the F-8E, with squadrons
      like VMFA-235 considered to be among the best at using the aircraft in combat.

    vehicleInfo: 'The F-4J is one of the most famous variants of the Phantom used
      by the US Navy. The external appearance closely resembles the F-4C, only missing
      the unusable IRST underneath the nose. It is a different aircraft from the
      F-4E, its US Air Force counterpart: lacking the "Agile Eagle" wing slats and
      devastating Vulcan Gatling cannon, the F-4J is even less suitable for dogfights.
      It also does not have the F-4E''s lethal ground attack arsenal of air-to-ground
      missiles and glide bombs. The F-4J makes up for these deficiencies by having
      a very powerful pulse-Doppler radar, long-range AIM-7F missiles, and a unique
      VTAS helmet-mounted sight for cueing its AIM-9G Sidewinder missiles. This is
      a Phantom for pilots who can turn technological superiority into air superiority,
      and it is good preparation for the succeeding F-14A Tomcat.'

    vehicleInfo: Introduced in Update "Starfighters", the Su-7B is a very capable
      fighter/bomber. Unlike many supersonic aircraft at its BR, the Su-7B has a
      very good acceleration and outspeeds almost any other supersonic fighter except
      for the MiG-21s and the F-104 Starfighters. For a strike aircraft it has a
      decent manoeuvrability, this allows it to fight aircraft like the MiG-21s and
      Harriers but without losing too much energy. However the Su-7B excels in terms
      of ground ordnance, even though it lacks any sort of guided munitions, it has
      ballistics computers for both bombs and rockets. It has enough payload to destroy
      a full base with the ZB-360 incendiary bombs and for ground RB it can use the
      S-24 or S-5K rockets.

    vehicleInfo: The Su-7BKL was produced in large numbers, with a total of 700 units
      built. This makes it the most produced variant of the Su-7 design. The Su-7BKL
      was an upgrade over the Su-7B variant. It required less runway for takeoff
      and landings in both paved and dirt. The aircraft featured rocket boosters
      to decrease the amount of time required to takeoff, reducing the distance to
      800 m, which was considerably less than the 1,250 m of the Su-7B. It also had
      an improved landing chute and a stronger rear landing gear. It was produced
      up to 1971 when it was replaced by the Su-17. It also received an export variant,
      Su-7BMK, produced until 1965 for countries outside of the Warsaw pact.

    vehicleInfo: Almost immediately after the Su-7 fighter-bomber was accepted into
      service in 1959, a directorate was issued to vastly upgrade the aircraft, as
      technology of the '50s and '60s was rapidly advancing and leaving the Su-7
      behind. Throughout the early '60s, many avionics and ordnance upgrades were
      experimented with, but the largest change would not come from the Soviets,
      but rather, the Americans. In 1964, the culmination of the USAF's TFX program,
      the F-111 "Aardvark", performed its first flight, and presented to the world
      the dynamics of variable-geometry wings. The Soviets, as not to be out-done,
      hammered a partially variable geometry wing (only the outer half of the wing
      could pivot) into their updated Su-7 prototype, and redubbed it the Su-17.

    vehicleInfo: During the late 1970s, a final and ultimate modernization of the
      Su-17M fighter-bomber was ordered. The aircraft was upgraded with RSDN navigation,
      Klyon-57 laser targeting system, SPO-15LE RWR system, the IT-23M optical targeting
      system for the TUBUS-3 seeker on the Kh-29T missile, and the ability to use
      the BA-58 targeting system for anti-radiation missiles. The only way to externally
      distinguish the Su-17M4 over its predecessor, the Su-17M3, is by the presence
      of multiple extra bleed-air intakes in the rear fuselage, the most noticable
      one being at the base of the vertical stabilizer. The aircraft would first
      fly in 1980 and quickly enter service shortly after, supplementing the Su-17M3
      fleet throughout the '80s and early '90s

      distinguish the Su-17M4 over its predecessor, the Su-17M3, is by the presence
      of multiple extra bleed-air intakes in the rear fuselage, the most noticable
      one being at the base of the vertical stabilizer. The aircraft would first
      fly in 1980 and quickly enter service shortly after, supplementing the Su-17M3
      fleet throughout the '80s and early '90s
