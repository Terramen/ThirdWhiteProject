    playerInfo: Seedorf is the only player in history to win the Champions League
      for three different clubs. In 1995, he won the trophy with Ajax when he was
      20 years old. Three years later, Clarence won the Champions League wearing
      a Real Madrid jersey. Seedorf was not a leading player at these clubs, but
      after moving to Milan in 2002, the Dutchman finally received recognition. Seedorf
      became a key figure in Milan. The more attacking Clarence, along with prop
      Gattuso and dispatcher Pirlo, created the most powerful trio in Italy, which
      dominated the field for 9 years. At Milan, Seedorf won the Champions League
      Cup twice more and won two championships.

    playerName: Andrea Pirlo
    playerInfo: 'Pirlo is one of the best controllers in the history of football.
      He had excellent vision of the field and an accurate pass, which allowed him
      to make aggravating passes even from inside the penalty area. Initially, Andrea
      played as an attacking midfielder, but could not prove himself - he lacked
      a powerful blow and speed. In 2001, Pirlo moved to Milan, where Carlo Ancelotti
      moved him into the holding zone. In this position, the Italian became the main
      player of the team: the distance from the opponent allowed him to better realize
      his skill of accurate long-range passing. With Milan, Pirlo became Italian
      champion twice and won two Champions League cups.'

      team, he won three tournaments in a row: two European Championships and a World
      Championship. Xavi spent almost his entire career at Barcelona. Here he played
      767 matches, scored 85 goals and gave 185 assists. During Pep Guardiola''s
      tenure as manager, Xavi became a key component of the iconic tiki-taka style
      of play where the most important thing was to move and hold the ball quickly
      and prevent opponents from getting close to him.'

    playerName: "Andr\xE9s Iniesta"
    playerInfo: 'Iniesta is the second key player of his generation for Barcelona
      and the Spanish national team. He played as long at the club as Xavi: he came
      three years earlier and left three years later. During this time, Andres won
      32 club trophies, and with the national team he won two European champion titles
      and one world champion. Iniesta and Xavi were rarely rated separately, but
      their playing styles were somewhat different. Iniesta is a more attacking player.
      For club and country, he was responsible for moving the ball in the final third
      and connecting with finishing combinations. Xavi is a more defensive player
      who was most often found deep in the field and accelerated the game from there.'

      received three Golden Balls. During his career, he played in only three clubs,
      and in each of them he scored more than 50 goals - despite the fact that he
      played only as a midfielder. With Platini''s help, the average Nancy consistently
      ranked at the top of the championship and won the French Cup for the first
      time - Michel scored the winning goal. After Nancy, the Frenchman played in
      Saint-Etienne, where he became the champion of France, but he truly blossomed
      in the Italian Juventus. As part of the Turin team, Platini became the champion
      of Italy twice, won the country''s Cup and won three international tournaments:
      the Cup Winners'' Cup, the European Cup and the Intercontinental Cup.'

      Zinedine's goal was the winning goal in the Champions League final, and a year
      later Zizou led the club to the championship in Spain.

    playerName: Alessandro Nesta
    playerInfo: "Calm and reliable are two words that immediately come to mind when
      talking about Italian defender Alessandro Nesta. The legendary Pele himself
      said that in order for the Brazilian team to win with ease, it is necessary
      that they have Nesta in defense. But alas, Alessandro, nicknamed \u201CThe
      Boss,\u201D did not play for the Brazilian national team, but for the Italian
      national team, with which he won gold at the 2006 World Cup. Nesta had a brilliant
      career, both at club and national team level. The defender began his great
      journey with Lazio, and continued it in Milan. It is worth saying that with
      both clubs the footballer won Serie A, and with the Rossoneri he has already
      won the Champions League twice."

    playerName: Roberto Carlos
    playerInfo: "Roberto Carlos is a Brazilian who has greatly influenced the functionality
      of full-backs. You could say he revolutionized this position. His incredible
      speed, pace, desire to constantly run forward and grab the ball from the opponent\u2019s
      feet simply cannot go unnoticed and unrewarded. Today, Carlos is in the TOP
      10 of the best defenders in the world in the history of football, and if we
      look specifically at the left flank, then here he is practically unrivaled
      to this day, if you do not take Maldini into account. Roberto Carlos had an
      excellent club career and truly demonstrated his talent in Real Madrid, with
      whom he won 4 Examples and 3 Champions League Cups. Little Carlos also achieved
      no less success in the Brazilian national team. The defender became the 2002
      world champion and in the same year took 2nd place in the Golden Ball nomination."

      of his popularity, winning the 2014 World Cup with the Bundesteam team led
      by Joachim L\xF6w. Some consider Lahm to be the best right-back in the history
      of football, although the \u201Clittle giant\u201D has a worthy competitor
      in this position in Cafu from Brazil. Philipp Lahm had excellent ball control,
      excellent speed and field vision. He was considered a universal football player,
      as he could play on the defensive flank and even in the defensive zone. Lam
      was, in his own way, the team\u2019s dispatcher, and everyone respected him

      or \u201CShark\u201D. Carles Puyol spent his entire career in the Catalan Barcelona,
      where he became one of the public's favorites and helped the Blaugranas achieve
      great heights in the domestic and international arenas. Puol was a brave, selfless
      and intelligent defender. The coaches loved the Spaniard for his ability to
      organize the play of his partners in defense - he was the leader and commander
      of the team, who instilled fear in all the opposing forwards. Puyol was simply
      superb in terms of tactical strength, playing on the second level and tackling
      the ball. Carles performed best in central defense, but his versatility also
      allowed him to play on the right and left flanks."

      Madrid for \u20AC27 million, which at that time was a record for young Spanish
      players. As a result, this transfer became one of the most successful in the
      history of the \u201Croyal club\u201D. Ramos is a real find for coaches, because
      he is a versatile defender who is reliable in the back, but also brings a lot
      of value in front. Sergio loves to connect to attacks and on the second floor
      this monster simply cannot be outplayed. During his career, the center back
      scored many important goals and today he is one of the most productive defenders
      in the world. It is worth noting that the football player scores goals not
      only from the game, but also often from the penalty spot."

      is a worker with a steely mind, capable of always being at peak concentration
      during matches. His incredible reflexes and relaxation made him one of the
      best goalkeepers of all time. With Bayern Munich he won 9 national titles,
      as well as 6 German Cups and a UEFA Cup. After losing the Champions League
      final in 1999, he finally won the trophy in 2001. In the final, he, in particular,

    playerInfo: Manuel Neuer is one of the best goalkeepers of this generation. He
      revolutionized the goalkeeper position, placing very high in the rankings and
      being much more involved in the game. His runs outside the box and ease with
      the ball on his feet almost make him look like a libero. Neuer is still active,
      but he is already a legend of the German team and Bayern Munich, one of the
      best European clubs in history. As part of the Bavarian club, the German goalkeeper
      became the German champion 8 times and won the Champions League twice in 2013
